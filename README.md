This was a small side-project of mine that started before the pandemic and eventually ended when I got bored of it. Wiseman was a general purpose discord bot which was originally only meant for my friend's discord server. It was hosted on glitch.com and was kept online by an uptime robot monitor. This method was eventually patched, which is the main reason the project died.
